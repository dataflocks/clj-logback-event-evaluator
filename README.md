# clj-logback-event-evaluator

![CI](https://github.com/dataflocks/clj-logback-event-evaluator/workflows/CI/badge.svg?branch=main)

A logback [EventEvaluator](http://logback.qos.ch/manual/filters.html#evalutatorFilter) that evaluates clojure expressions.

In projects where clojure is already a dependency it helps avoid an additional
dependency on eg Janino when dynamic filtering of log events is desired.

```
*** Warning ***

The expressions are eval'd and there is currently no sandboxing in place. Please
take into consideration for your specific use case and proceed at your own risk!
```

## Usage

Once it's added your project dependencies it can be used like any other
`EventEvaluator`. Here's a translation of a [Janino example](http://logback.qos.ch/manual/filters.html#JaninoEventEvaluator):

```xml
<configuration>
  <appender name="STDOUT" class="ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender">
    <filter class="ch.qos.logback.core.filter.EvaluatorFilter">
        <evaluator class="dataflocks.CljLogbackEventEvaluator">
	  <expression>(.contains msg "billing")</expression>
	</evaluator>
        <OnMismatch>NEUTRAL</OnMismatch>
        <OnMatch>DENY</OnMatch>
    </filter>
    <encoder>
      <pattern>
        %-4relative [%thread] %-5level %logger - %msg%n
      </pattern>
    </encoder>
  </appender>

  <root level="INFO">
    <appender-ref ref="STDOUT" />
  </root>
</configuration>
```

### Sugar

The Evaluator provides access to the [ILoggingEvent](https://logback.qos.ch/apidocs/ch/qos/logback/classic/spi/ILoggingEvent.html) via `event`,
as well as to some of it's members via the mapping in [dataflocks.clj-logback-event-evaluator](src/dataflocks/clj_logback_event_evaluator.clj#L12)

In a Evaluator Expression, this should hold for example:

```clojure
(= msg (.getMessage event))
```
